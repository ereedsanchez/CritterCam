# CritterCam
CritterCam at Black Rock Forest. A solar powered forest video hack for Wyze Cams. 

### Purpose
This repository is a ecological technology based art project by Edwin Reed-Sanchez, Garrett Huff, Tony Baizan, and Scott La Point. 
The purpose is to create an inexpensive DIY solar powered critter cam using wyzecams ($25) and creating enviornments for critters to live.  
We are creating baited camera boxes where birds, chipmunks, and other creatures would be captured by wireless cameras connected to the Black Rock Forest Wifi Mesh Network.   

The inside of the boxes will be decorated like apartments.  

We will be guided by science, from Dr. Scott LaPoint, on best practices to capture images of animals in the field.

## Instructions

### The Camera
#### 1. Hack the Wyzecam
#### 2. Send Wyzecam feed to Youtube

### The Box
#### 1. Building a Box
#### 2. Set the Camera

### The Solar Power
#### 1. Solar Power Kit
Wyzecams with out the RTSP Hack use: 2.2 Watts, 0.032 Amps, 123 Volts
- Using the following calculators: https://www.altestore.com/store/calculators/load_calculator/, https://www.altestore.com/store/calculators/off_grid_calculator/. 
- Wyzecam uses 53 kWH per day, based on 2.2W, 24 hours a day. 
- Wyzecam requires a battery bank of 25 amp hours (four 8 Amp lead acid battery) for a 12V system, with 2 days running with out sun. 
- Solar Powered Required is 34.5 Watts / 12 Volt Solar Panel. with 2 hours of Sunlight.  

Rough Calculation: 1 Wyze Cam / 44 WH per day / 11 amps battery bank (two 8 Amp batteries) / 28-57 Watt (12V) Panel for 1-2 hours of light per day.  


Wyzecams with the RTSP Hack use: ?? Watts, ?? Amps, 


### The Science
#### 1. Where are the animals
#### 2. The Birdhouse
#### 3. The Chipmunk House
